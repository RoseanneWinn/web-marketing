        <p class="quote">
          <i>"We needed to quickly consolidate multiple Microsoft Access databases scattered across 7 branch offices. Creating our own reporting solution would have taken several months and cost close to six figures. Worst of all, it would have rendered our employees unable to access their data until the new system was finished and tested. This could have meant a lot of lost productivity. We looked at several products, but none of them offered the immediate implementation, intuitive user interface and gentle learning curve that Izenda Reports provides. Just weeks after we first found out about Izenda, we had a secure solution that went above and beyond what we originally expected."</i><br />

          <i>"This product is great. It's perfect for someone who needs lightweight reporting and doesn't want to get bogged down in complicated and confusing features. And our customers like that we're able to hand them reports of their activity over the last six months and then run other reports on that same data for comparison - all while they're sitting in the office. They've been so impressed with the additional service level, some have even asked if we are going to charge more."</i><br />

Our old reports were always at least three or four months old by the time they got to our group. Izenda Reports allows us to see the timely data we need to monitor staff productivity and performance. When things change, we can change our reports - that day. Izenda Reports has become an indispensable member of our team."</i><br />
