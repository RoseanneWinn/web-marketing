            Auric saved two-man years of development or $200,000 by going with Izenda Reports. &nbsp; Augmenting their product with a flexible reporting solution, enabled Auric to differentiate itself with a significant competitive advantage over larger competitors, and increase their own profitability by selling into a higher tier of enterprise customers.&nbsp; The decision to go with Izenda yielded cost savings, an improvement to their value proposition to their customers, and a vital time-to-market jump.&nbsp; They were able to enjoy the fruits of these benefits immediately, instead of waiting through a lengthy deployment and learning curve.</p>

            <p>
            In an era of shrinking budgets, the Georgia DNR needed to analyze security staffing needs by gaining greater visibility into incidents at 63 state parks and historic sites.&nbsp; They needed to be able to aggregate information maintained in separate locations, and a flexible way to analyze that information to help them make better decisions about resource allocation.&nbsp; As organization not wanting to further invest in IT staff, Izenda Reports allowed them to empower users to run, create and change reports themselves.&nbsp; Easy to use and able to grow with the organization, the rich client interface required minimal training, even for non-technical users.</p>

            LP Software provides a software solution that helps large retailers with loss prevention.&nbsp; The software came with 40 static reports managers could use to gain insight into where and how their inventory shrinkage may be occurring.&nbsp; LP Software&rsquo;s clients, which include Nike, JC Penney, Barnes and Noble, and Kroger, wanted to be able to run their own unique reports to capture the circumstances surrounding their loss issues.&nbsp; To extend the utility of their software package and meet these customer requests for customized reporting capabilities, LP Software found that Izenda Reports was the most cost effective and user friendly tool on the market. &nbsp; LP Software President Brian Eskra believes that half of his clients will choose to use the tool by the end of 2007.</p>
